The data above consist of a sample of 2,500 peer-to-peer 
loans issued through the Lending Club 
(https://www.lendingclub.com/home.action). The interest 
rate of these loans is determined by the Lending Club on 
the basis of characteristics of the person asking for the 
loan such as their employment history, credit history, and 
creditworthiness scores. 

The purpose of your analysis is to identify and quantify 
associations between the interest rate of the loan and 
the other variables in the data set. In particular, you 
should consider whether any of these variables have an 
important association with interest rate after taking 
into account the applicant's FICO score. For example, if 
two people have the same FICO score, can the other variables 
explain a difference in interest rate between them?
